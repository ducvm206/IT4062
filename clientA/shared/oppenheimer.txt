A VAST SPHERE OF FIRE, the fire of a thousand suns, slowly
eats the night-time desert. A line of black type appears:
PROMETHEUS STOLE FIRE FROM THE GODS AND GAVE IT TO MAN.
And the sound of DOZENS OF FEET STAMPING RHYTHMICALLY...
FOR THIS HE WAS CHAINED TO A ROCK AND TORTURED FOR ETERNITY.
ROILING PLASMA expands, the sound of STAMPING GROWS
OPPRESSIVE, the STAMPING FASTER and FASTER OVERA FACE. Gaunt, tense, EYES TIGHTLY SHUT. The face SHUDDERSthe sound CEASES AS MY EYES OPEN, STARING INTO THE CAMERA:
Peer into my soul- J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, aged fifty, closecropped greying hair. The gentle sounds of bureaucracy...
SUPER TITLE: "1. FISSION"
VOICE (O.S.)
Dr Oppenheimer, as we begin, I
believe you have a statement to
read into the record?
I glance down at my notes.
OPPENHEIMER
Yes, your honourSECOND VOICE (O.S.)
We’re not judges, doctor.
OPPENHEIMER
No. Of course.
(I start reading)
Members of the Security Board, the
so-called derogatory information in
your indictment of me cannot be
fairly understood except in the
context of my life and work. This

aspects of my life in more or less
chronological order...

INT. SENATE OFFICE -- DAY (BLACK-AND-WHITE SEQUENCE)
CLOSE: on a prosperous sixty-three-year-old man, LEWIS
STRAUSS, as he takes a cup of coffee from a SENATE AIDE...
SUPER TITLE: "2. FUSION"
STRAUSS
I forget. Three days, or so. The
whole hearing took a month.
SENATE AIDE
An ordeal.
STRAUSS
I’ve only read the transcripts, but
who’d want to justify their whole
life?
SENATE AIDE
You weren’t there?
STRAUSS
As Chairman, I wasn’t allowed to
be. Are they really going to ask
about it? It was years ago.
SENATE AIDE
Four years ago. Oppenheimer still
divides America- the committee will
want to know where you stood.
(checks his watch)
Ready?
INT. CORRIDOR, SENATE BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER (B&W)
The Senate Aide leads Strauss along the corridor.
SENATE AIDE
Senator Thurmond asked me to say
not to feel you’re on trial.
STRAUSS
I didn’t, till you said that.
